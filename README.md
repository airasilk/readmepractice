# Basic Calculator

## Project description
This project does basic two number calculations. The user is first asked to choose a calculation method (+ , - , * , /) and then input two numbers.

## Project bugs
1. Division by 0 is not possible.
   ```python
       elif choice == '4':
         if num2 == 0:
           print("Error! Cannot divide by zero.")
3. Doing a calculation with more than two numbers is not possible.
4. ```hello world~```
